AI-Automate an intelectual task normaly done by humans.In the begining ther was no Ml NO DL only a set of rules was/is considered ai.
Parts of AI:-
ML-Figueres out the rules for us.Diagram:-
data------>|`````````````````````````````````|
           |                                 |------->Anwers
Rules----->|_________________________________|                                 
                 CLASSICAL PROGRAMMING

                     ML Programming


Goal of ML's-->fewest mistakes
   I->P->
   I->P->    o
   I->P->
   I-input data P-Rules O-output

Parts Of Ml:-
   Neural Netwok:-
   Uses a form of machine learning that uses a layered representaion of data
   I->p1\
          -->p2\
   I->p1/       
                 -->p3\
   I->p1\
          -->p2/
   I->p1/
                          ---->O
   I->p1\
           -->p2\
   I->p1/
                  -->p3/
   I->p1\
           -->p2/
   I->p1/

   All the p have different transformation
   SO they are layers
