Core Learning Algorithms:-
   -Linear Regression
        -Linear regression is one of the most basic forms of machine learning and is used to predict numeric values.
        -Linear regression follows a very simple concept. If data points are related linearly, we can generate a line of best fit for these points and use it to predict future values
        -if you have a graph and there are multiple data points in which the values are scaling linearly you can use linear regression
        -Essentialy you make a line'/axis which goes through all the dsta points this is called the line f best fit

tf.feature_column.categorical_column_with_vocabulary_list(feature_name, vocabulary)
converting object to intiger/key
tf.feature_column.numeric_column(feature_name, dtype=tf.float32)
convert int/float to tf readable
