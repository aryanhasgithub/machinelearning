AI-Automate an intelectual task normaly done by humans.In the begining ther was no Ml NO DL only a set of rules was/is considered ai.
Parts of AI:-
ML-Figueres out the rules for us.Diagram:-
data------>|`````````````````````````````````|
           |                                 |------->Anwers
Rules----->|_________________________________|                                 
                 CLASSICAL PROGRAMMING

                     ML Programming


Goal of ML's-->fewest mistakes
   I->P->
   I->P->    o
   I->P->
   I-input data P-Rules O-output

Parts Of Ml:-
   Neural Netwok:-
   Uses a form of machine learning that uses a layered representaion of data
   I->p1\
          -->p2\
   I->p1/       
                 -->p3\
   I->p1\
          -->p2/
   I->p1/
                          ---->O
   I->p1\
           -->p2\
   I->p1/
                  -->p3/
   I->p1\
           -->p2/
   I->p1/

   All the p have different transformation
   SO they are layers

Some more def:-
*********DATA IS VERY IMPORTATANT****************
Features:-Info we feed to the model
Label:-The thing we want to predict
Training Data:- all our features and Label(the outcome or the answers)
Test data-Only features
Types of ML:-
           -Supervised Learning:-
           -We have features which lead to lable/labels
           -We have both informations
           -Most Common/Applicable
           Diagram:-
                                  Supervisor           
                                      |
                                      |
                       training data       expected output
                             |                    |            
           raw/newdata---->************algorithm************* --->Output

-Unsupervised:-
           -Only features
           -Model generate lable
           -Model Groups Data(Example)
           
- Reinforcement:-
           -    Agent->solver
           -    Enviroment->Self explanatory
           -    Reward->Prize for agent
           -    for every step in right direction/closer to target you give the agent and reward
           -    For wrong step negitve reward to agent
           -    Agents wants to Maximize reward
           -    Learns from - and + rewards
